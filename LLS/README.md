# KNN-Based Image Processing and Classification

This repository demonstrates the use of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for various applications, including **image processing** with Nemo and Dory, and **dataset classification** with IRIS and Breast Cancer datasets.

## **Finding Nemo**
This project focuses on removing the background and detecting Nemo in images using HSV color space and KNN.

### **Steps:**
1. Implemented the `KNN` class for classification.
2. Created a training dataset by labeling Nemo pixels (ðŸŸ orange, âšªwhite, âš«black) and background pixels.
3. Trained the KNN classifier with the labeled dataset.
4. Predicted Nemo pixels in new test images and removed the background.
5. Encapsulated all steps in the `FindingNemo` class for automation.

### **Technologies Used:** 
Python (OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib)

### **Result:**

**Training Image**:

   <img src = "Nemo/nemo.jpg" width = "400">

   <img src = "Nemo/result/output.png" width = "400">

**Test Image**:

   <img src = "Nemo/dashe-nemo.jpg" width = "400">

   <img src = "Nemo/result/output2.png" width = "400">

## **Finding Dory**
Building on the Nemo project, this section extends the algorithm for detecting Dory. The HSV color space and KNN classifier are adapted for Dory's unique color scheme.

### **Steps:**
1. Labeled pixels for Doryâ€™s colors (e.g., ðŸ”µblue and ðŸŸ¡yellow) and background pixels.
2. Trained the KNN classifier on Dory-specific data.
3. Predicted and segmented Dory pixels in new test images.

### **Result:**

**Training Image**:

  <img src = "Dory/dory.png" width = "400">

  <img src = "Dory/outputs/output.png" width = "400">

**Test Image**:

  <img src = "Dory/dory-300x185.jpg" width = "400">

  <img src = "Dory/outputs/output2.png" width = "400">

## **IRIS Dataset**
The IRIS dataset is used to classify different species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on features such as sepal and petal dimensions.

### **Steps:**
1. Loaded the IRIS dataset using Scikit-learn.
2. Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).
3. Implemented and trained the `KNN` algorithm.
4. Evaluated with different values of `k` (e.g., 3, 5, 7) and calculated accuracy and confusion matrix.

### **Accuracy Results:**

   | **k Value** | **Accuracy (%)** |
   |-------------|------------------|
   | 3           | 100.0            |
   | 5           | 100.0            |
   | 7           | 96.6             |

### **Confusion Matrix (3x3):**

   <img src = "Iris_dataset/output.png" width = "400">

## **Breast Cancer Dataset**
The Breast Cancer dataset is used to classify patients based on diagnostic data (e.g., malignant or benign).

### **Steps:**
1. Loaded the Breast Cancer dataset using Scikit-learn.
2. Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).
3. Implemented and trained the `KNN` algorithm.
4. Evaluated with different values of `k` (e.g., 3, 5, 7) and calculated accuracy and confusion matrix.

### **Accuracy Results:**

   | **k Value** | **Accuracy (%)** |
   |-------------|------------------|
   | 3           | 93.8             |
   | 5           | 92.9             |
   | 7           | 95.6             |
