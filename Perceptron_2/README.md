# Perceptron (Perception Neuron)

This repository showcases the **Perceptron Algorithm** applied to both classification and regression tasks. The perceptron is implemented as an object-oriented algorithm and is used to explore linear models in various datasets, including binary classification and weather prediction problems.

## Projects

### **1. Surgical Dataset üè®**
A binary classification task using the perceptron algorithm. 

- **Key Steps**:
  - Train an object-oriented perceptron on the surgical dataset for binary classification.
  - Plot the **accuracy** and **loss** for both training and testing data at each epoch.
  - Calculate and visualize the confusion matrix.
  - Experiment with 5 different activation functions: `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `relu`, `linear`.

### **2. Weather Prediction üå¶**
A unique regression problem focused on hourly weather data collected over multiple years.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Convert dates into "day of the year" format (e.g., Ordibehesht 2 ‚Üí Day 33, Esfand 29 ‚Üí Day 365).
  - Compute daily average temperatures from 24 hourly temperature records for each day.

- **Linear Model Training**:
  - Train a linear perceptron model on the weather dataset.
  - Implement the following functions:
    - **evaluate**: Calculate loss and accuracy for the perceptron model.
    - **predict**: Predict daily temperatures based on the "day of the year."
  - Plot the **loss** and **accuracy** progression during training.

- **Visualization**:
  - Generate a table of daily average temperatures and their corresponding "day of the year."
  - Visualize the data and model predictions on a chart.

- **Stored Results**:
  - Save trained weights (`weights.npy`) and biases (`bias.npy`) to files for future use.

- **Limitations**:
  - Although the data is non-linear, a linear perceptron is intentionally used to create a baseline. Future comparisons will be made with non-linear models.

## Features

### **Custom Perceptron Implementation**
- Object-oriented structure for modularity and flexibility.
- Support for multiple activation functions (`sigmoid`, `tanh`, `relu`, `linear`).

### **Data Visualization**
- Plots for loss and accuracy at each epoch for both training and testing phases.
- Confusion matrix visualization for classification tasks.
- Scatterplots for regression predictions and data.

### **Data Preprocessing**
- Efficient handling of time-based weather data.
- Transformation of dates into "day of the year" format.
- Computation of daily averages from hourly temperature records.

### **Model Training**
- Hyperparameter tuning: Learn and adjust learning rates, epochs, and activation functions.
- Save model weights and biases for reproducibility (`weights.npy`, `bias.npy`).
