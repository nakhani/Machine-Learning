# MLP Using TensorFlow

This repository contains two projects: **Weather Prediction** and **House Price Prediction**. Each project implements machine learning models using neural networks to solve specific tasks. Below is a description of both projects, along with their objectives and instructions.

## Projects

### **1. Weather Prediction ðŸŒ¦**
focusing on predicting weather using neural networks.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Convert dates into "day of the year" format (e.g., Ordibehesht 2 â†’ Day 33, Esfand 29 â†’ Day 365).
  - Compute daily average temperatures from 24 hourly temperature records for each day.

- **MLP Model Training**:
  - Implement a neural network model for weather prediction..
  - Implement the following functions:
    - **evaluate**: Calculate loss for the MLP model.
    - **predict**: Predict daily temperatures based on the "day of the year."
  - Plot the **loss** progression during training.

- **Visualization**:
  - Generate a table of daily average temperatures and their corresponding "day of the year."

### **2. House Price Prediction**

### Objective:
Build a neural network model to predict house sale prices based on the dataset provided.

### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical features.

2. **Data Splitting**:
   - Divide the dataset into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.

3. **Model Implementation**:
   - Create and train a neural network model to predict house sale prices.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model on the validation dataset.


5. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices for unseen data.

6. **Model Saving**:
   - Save the trained model with a `.h5` extension using `model.save()`.
